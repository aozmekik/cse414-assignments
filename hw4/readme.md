1- What are the advantages and disadvantages of B+ tree for using it for indexing in
databases?
2- What are the advantages and disadvantages of hashing for using it for indexing in
databases?
3- Indices speed query processing, but it is usually a bad idea to create indices on every
attribute, and every combination of attributes, that are potential search keys.
Explain why.
4- Is it possible in general to have two clustering indices on the same relation for
different search keys? Explain your answer.
5- Suppose you have a relation r with nr tuples on which a secondary B+-tree is to be
constructed.
a. Give a formula for the cost of building the B+-tree index by inserting one
record at a time. Assume each block will hold an average of f entries and that
all levels of the tree above the leaf are in memory.
b. Assuming a random disk access takes 10 milliseconds, what is the cost of
index construction on a relation with 10 million records?
6- Suppose there is a relation r(A,B,C), with a B+-tree index with search key (A, B).
a. What is the worst-case cost of finding records satisfying 10 < A < 50 using this
index, in terms of the number of records retrieved n 1 and the height h of the
tree?
b. What is the worst-case cost of finding records satisfying 10 < A < 50 âˆ§ 5 < B <
10 using this index, in terms of the number of records n 2 that satisfy this
selection, as well as n 1 and h defined above?
7- Given the relations listed below,
Let us define a view branch cust as follows:
create view branch cust as
select branch name, customer name
from depositor, account
where depositor.account number = account.account numbera- Suppose that the view is materialized; that is, the view is computed and stored. Write
triggers to maintain the view, that is, to keep it up-to-date on insertions to depositor
or account. It is not necessary to handle deletions or updates. Note that, for simplicity,
we have not required the elimination of duplicates.
b- Write an SQL trigger to carry out the following action: On delete of an account, for
each customer-owner of the account, check if the owner has any remaining accounts,
and if she does not, delete her from the depositor relation.
8- Give characteristics of NoSQL. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?
